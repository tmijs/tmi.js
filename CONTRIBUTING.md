# Contributing to tmi.js

If you would like to contribute code you can do so through GitHub by forking the repository and sending a pull request.

When submitting code, please make every effort to follow existing conventions and style in order to keep the code as readable as possible.

## What you should know before contributing

We now have very precise rules with the way commit messages are formatted. Having commits formatted this way is more readable and easier when looking through the history of tmi.js. We also use this format to retrieve the changelog automatically on the website.

### Commit message format

Each and every commit message must include a **scope** and a **subject** and your commit **must be lowercase**:
* ``<scope>: subject``

The scope name is the filename without extension, and the subject is what you have changed / fixed in the code.
A few examples:

* ``client: your commit message here.``
* ``utils: your commit message here.``
